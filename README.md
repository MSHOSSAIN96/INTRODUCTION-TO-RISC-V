# INTRODUCTION-TO-RISC-V
Learn the basics of the RISC-V ISA and the community ecosystem


                                                                                                                      **Gett RISC-V:**
**Introduction:**

Chapter Overview and Objectives

In this chapter, we will embark on a journey to discover the world of RISC-V – a technology, an organization, and a community. As you read through these pages, you will grasp the fundamental essence of RISC-V.

This chapter also explores everything there is to know about the RISC-V organization – RISC-V International. We will go over the history of RISC-V from its origins as an academic program through its current incarnation as a global non-profit organization, as well as the organizations within RISC-V – technical and non-technical.

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

Describe the philosophy of RISC-V.

List the goals of RISC-V International as a community-driven organization.

Describe the organization around the RISC-V community.

Understand how member organizations work together to develop an open source community.

Know how to contribute and make a difference within the RISC-V community.

So, relax, sit back, and allow the layers of RISC-V to unfold before you, revealing an organized ecosystem that is shaping the future of computing.

**Exploring RISC-V:**
About RISC-V
RISC processors – short for Reduced Instruction Set Computer - were first designed in the 1980s as an evolution of earlier designs.

In practice, the term RISC-V can refer to several different things depending on context:

The Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
The community of users and developers of the ISA
RISC-V International, the organization that owns and maintains the ISA intellectual property
The hardware and IP products that are built on the ISA
As you can see, each of these things revolves around the ISA as the central component, but all of these things are RISC-V. In general, we use RISC-V in conversation to refer to the technology components – the ISA and its various specifications – while the other contexts are the RISC-V community, RISC-V International, and RISC-V hardware, respectively.
