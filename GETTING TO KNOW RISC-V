# INTRODUCTION-TO-RISC-V
Learn the basics of the RISC-V ISA and the community ecosystem


**Introduction:**

Chapter Overview and Objectives

In this chapter, we will embark on a journey to discover the world of RISC-V – a technology, an organization, and a community. As you read through these pages, you will grasp the fundamental essence of RISC-V.

This chapter also explores everything there is to know about the RISC-V organization – RISC-V International. We will go over the history of RISC-V from its origins as an academic program through its current incarnation as a global non-profit organization, as well as the organizations within RISC-V – technical and non-technical.

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

Describe the philosophy of RISC-V.

List the goals of RISC-V International as a community-driven organization.

Describe the organization around the RISC-V community.

Understand how member organizations work together to develop an open source community.

Know how to contribute and make a difference within the RISC-V community.

So, relax, sit back, and allow the layers of RISC-V to unfold before you, revealing an organized ecosystem that is shaping the future of computing.

                                                                                                                 **Exploring RISC-V:**

**About RISC-V**

RISC processors – short for Reduced Instruction Set Computer - were first designed in the 1980s as an evolution of earlier designs.

In practice, the term RISC-V can refer to several different things depending on context:

The Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

The community of users and developers of the ISA

RISC-V International, the organization that owns and maintains the ISA intellectual property

The hardware and IP products that are built on the ISA.

As you can see, each of these things revolves around the ISA as the central component, but all of these things are RISC-V. In general, we use RISC-V in conversation to refer to the technology components – the ISA and its various specifications – while the other contexts are the RISC-V community, RISC-V International, and RISC-V hardware, respectively.

**The RISC-V ISA and Community**

ISA refers to the Instruction Set Architecture, an abstract model of a computer — in this case, a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (or RISC). The specification for this set of instructions is the 5th generation of RISC processors, which have been in development since the 1980s, thus we call it RISC-V.

Unlike technology developed by a privately owned company or consortium, RISC-V is developed by a community, a group of individuals and organizations who all contribute to the development of these specifications. Members of the community come from all walks of life — industry professionals, students, trainers, and anyone else with an interest in open technology and a willingness to learn more about it.

While all members have their own reason for participating, they all share a common interest in developing an openly available instruction set architecture specification and the ecosystem around it. This ecosystem is composed of a wide variety of elements:

Physical hardware: Processors, development boards, System-on-Chips (SoCs), System-on-Modules (SoMs), and other physical systems.

“Soft” IP processor cores that can be loaded into emulators, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), or implemented in silicon.

The entire software stack, from bootloaders and firmware, up to full operating systems and applications.

Educational material including courseware, curricula, lesson plans, online courses like this one, tutorials, podcasts, lab assignments, and even books.
Services including verification, custom board design, and many more.
All of this community output is recognized on the RISC-V Exchange, an organized section on the RISC-V website that describes the ecosystem in terms of available hardware and software, services, learning materials, and discussion points.

The website also lists much more information about the community, with links to member working groups as well as public mailing lists, organized information on the wiki, and of course the specifications themselves — both the completed, approved versions and the latest specs being developed.

So why do we refer to this as a community rather than a marketplace? The true reason is that we think a community is by far the best way to approach an effort as complex as building a new architecture from scratch, using proven open source development methods. RISC-V at its heart is a community of highly motivated people focused on the same goals and harnessing the power of working together with many hands to lift a heavy load.

**The Importance of Open Source & Open Standards**

RISC-V’s story begins at the UC Berkeley Parallel Computing Lab. To set the stage, we first discuss the importance of open source and open standards, as these directly apply to the development process and open licensing of the RISC-V ISA.

Technology does not persist in isolation, unless we are talking about exceptionally simple unconnected devices like a flashlight — and even there, we rely on international standards to connect the battery to the bulb. As our technical world has become more complex and more connected, global standards ensure that society may realize the profound benefits of interoperability from the inventor to the consumer.

Standards drive innovation at a base platform level from the standard threads on a machine screw to threads connecting silicon on a microprocessor. The setting of voluntary standards in engineering dates back more than a century. In the late 1980s through the 1990s, Tim Berners-Lee led a revolution to standardize the protocols we use on the internet (URL, HTML, HTTP, W3C), easily the biggest advance of technology utility in modern history. There are numerous examples that underpin the technology we rely on every day.

Advances in software and hardware standardization through global collaboration and consensus, as well as open source development and delivery of software and hardware design, has accelerated technical progress at an unprecedented global scale. The release of RISC-V to the open community, both for standardization and for ongoing improvement through open collaboration is at the core of RISC-V International. Without collaboration and open access to the RISC-V ISA and open extensions, the community risks fragmentation, forking, and the establishment of multiple standards.

As an Instruction Set Architecture, RISC-V itself is not “open source” in the same way that software is open, as an ISA is not made of source code. It is, however, an open specification, and it is released under a Creative Commons license. Other artifacts within RISC-V, such as software and compliance tests, use appropriate licenses (e.g. BSD and MIT) that retain the permissive original intent for RISC-V to be available to everyone.

**History of RISC and Open ISAs**

RISC stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computer, a computer architecture proposed in the early 1980s based on simplicity, as opposed to current microprocessors at the time, dubbed Complex Instruction Set Computers, or CISC. The RISC architecture was born in an academic environment, so the design strives for simplicity and efficiency, proposing a series of features that dramatically opposed the CISC philosophy, which was motivated by commercial interests at the time. RISC is the opposite of CISC in many ways. Usually, CISC CPUs have a few registers and lots of instructions, most of which have access to memory, whereas RISC CPUs have lots of registers and a very modest instruction set, with memory access restricted to a few Load and Store instructions.

Now, the distinction between a complex and a reduced instruction set is in the numbers: CISC instruction sets usually support lots of instructions, many performing complicated calculations for specific tasks, whereas RISC instruction sets have a modest number of simple, general-purpose instructions. As an example: Intel’s 80386 (the first 32-bit microprocessor) was launched in 1985 and supported over 150 instructions, whereas the RISC-V Base Integer ISA was released in 2010 and has only 40 instructions!

The RISC acronym was coined around 1980 by Prof. David Patterson at the University of California, Berkeley, whose work with Prof. John Hennessy at Stanford University yielded their celebrated books “Computer Organization and Design” and “Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach." Thanks to their work on the RISC architecture, they received the ACM A. M. Turing Award in 2017.

In many ways, the history of RISC is bound up with the history of MIPS processors. Both processor architectures have had great commercial success in different ways, although RISC architectures are arguably more likely to be recognized through some very popular designs, including Sun Microsystems’ SPARC line, DEC’s Alpha line, Intel’s i860 and i960 processors, and the ubiquitous ARM processors that inhabit billions of devices today from many silicon manufacturers. RISC-V is the latest iteration of this instruction set architecture.

Many RISC, MIPS, and other designs have been “open” to varying degrees. In 2005, Sun Microsystems opened the SPARC architecture, creating the OpenSPARC project under the GNU Public License (GPL). The OpenRISC project provides 32-bit and 64-bit cores through the OpenCores community under the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL), which is somewhat less restrictive than the GPL. The MIPS architecture, owned by Wave Computing, was provided under an “open use” license in a pilot program that closed down in 2019. Even ARM, which previously showed its architecture only to paying licensees, has now partly opened its architecture to changes by its partners. All of these efforts work to balance the needs and aspirations of partners and stakeholders with the realities of the marketplace, international laws around intellectual property, and the historic momentum in the industry that keeps leading toward open source, open specifications, and open standards.

The takeaway is that opening up an Instruction Set Architecture is both a highly valuable effort and a very difficult task. It requires collaboration among many stakeholders, protection from patent trolls and other lawsuits, and a clear path toward ownership for anyone basing their livelihood on the outcome. RISC-V is succeeding wildly because of its dedication to a fully open architecture, the protection provided and agreed to by all members, and its full commitment to community.

**RISC-V Origins: UC Berkeley Architecture Research**

Prof. Krste Asanović and graduate students Yunsup Lee and Andrew Waterman started the RISC-V instruction set in May 2010 as part of the Parallel Computing Laboratory (Par Lab) at UC Berkeley, of which Prof. David Patterson was Director. The Par Lab was a five-year project to advance parallel computing funded by Intel and Microsoft for $10M over 5 years, from 2008 to 2013. It also received funding from several other companies and the State of California. The Chisel hardware construction language that was used to design many RISC-V processors was also developed in the Par Lab.

All the projects in the Par Lab were open source using the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license, including RISC-V and Chisel.

The ISA specification itself, i.e., the encoding of the instruction set, was released with a permissive license (similar to the language of the BSD license) when the ISA tech reports were published., though the The actual tech report text (an expression of the specification) was later put under a Creative Commons license to allow it to be improved by external contributors, including the RISC-V Foundation.

No patents were filed related to RISC-V in any of these projects, as the RISC-V ISA itself does not represent any new technology. The RISC-V ISA is based on computer architecture ideas that date back at least 40 years. RISC processor implementations – including some based on other open ISA standards – are widely available from various vendors worldwide.

The worldwide interest in RISC-V is not because it is a great new chip technology. The interest is because it is a common free and open standard to which software can be ported, and which allows anyone to freely develop their own hardware to run the software. RISC-V International does not manage or make available any open source RISC-V implementations, only the standard specifications. RISC-V software is managed by the respective open source software projects.

**DARPA Influence**

After the invention of RISC-V, it was used by numerous companies, in many places. Countless projects used it, including research programs funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

The UC Berkeley ASPIRE Lab succeeded the Par Lab, and was led by Krste Asanović. It lasted from 2013 to 2018 and led to the building of several RISC-V compatible microprocessors. It had funding from DARPA as well as from many companies.

Basic research funding to universities is largely for unrestricted research with permission to publicly disseminate the results. This contract is the standard model for U.S. federal grants to universities, and allows for results from the funded work to be published in the open literature and made accessible worldwide to the public at large. The government retains rights to use any technology developed in the research, but unless explicitly stated, does not restrict the technology.

A related DARPA photonics program predates RISC-V, and funded research at MIT in 2006. The research supported the development of integrated silicon photonics. Later stages of funding at MIT and Berkeley were used to build prototype chips, which included RISC-V cores as infrastructure to demonstrate the photonic links.

The ASPIRE Lab was funded by the DARPA Power Efficiency Revolution for Embedded Computing Technologies (PERFECT) program. The goal of the program was to develop revolutionary approaches as well as the technologies and techniques to provide the power efficiency required to enable embedded computing systems. Researchers used RISC-V based systems to demonstrate the ideas in that program.

In all of these funded projects, the RISC-V ISA specification and RISC-V open source cores were not contract deliverables. RISC-V was just the infrastructure separately developed to support the funded research.

While DARPA did not fund the original RISC-V ISA definition, DARPA funding played a significant role in its later development. The linked articles on the SSITH Voting Machine and DOD presentation by Linton Salmon detail some of the areas where DARPA research continues to support RISC-V.

DARPA funds a large set of programs around open-source hardware technology. However, RISC-V International (the current owner of RISC-V) has never had DARPA funding, nor pursued or received funding from any government.

**Fun Fact: The RISC-V Name**

How did RISC-V get its name? The RISC portion is fairly obvious, but why is it number 5, and why is this represented with a Roman numeral?

The answer lies in a footnote in the introduction of the ISA spec itself:

The name RISC-V was chosen to represent the fifth major RISC ISA design from UC Berkeley (RISC-I [15], RISC-II [8], SOAR [21], and SPUR [11] were the first four). We also pun on the use of the Roman numeral “V” to signify “variations” and “vectors”, as support for a range of architecture research, including various data-parallel accelerators, is an explicit goal of the ISA design.

                                                                                            **RISC-V International**

**Introduction to RISC-V International**
So RISC-V is indeed a community. In fact, it is a global community spanning more than 40 countries and thousands of people. At the heart of this community is its home and guiding force — the RISC-V International Association.

RISC-V International, a Swiss non-profit organization, was formed in order to organize the activity around development of the ISA as well as other artifacts including software, non-ISA specifications, testing and compliance frameworks, and much more. RISC-V is organized by and for its members, which include over 200 large and small organizations as well as many hundreds of individual members who participate on their own, apart from companies or universities. The board of directors includes voting representatives from every membership level, so RISC-V is truly an egalitarian, community-based organization.

RISC-V International provides all of the management activities that are required by a global organization — executive management, promotion and marketing, member support, operations support, technical program management, and creative services. It also provides legal support for RISC-V intellectual property, which includes the specifications as well as RISC-V trademarks and imagery.

RISC-V International employs a small staff to assist and guide the community in organizing itself, and it maintains a contract with the Linux Foundation to provide management services, including human resources, IT and tools support, financial support, and more. The Linux Foundation brings many years of experience in running open source foundations and projects, which benefits the RISC-V community directly in helping to achieve its mission.

RISC-V International does not produce hardware. Instead, it provides the basis for all of its member organizations to create new technology based on the foundational support of the RISC-V ISA. As an open specifications project, RISC-V mainly produces documentation in the form of specifications like the Instruction Set Architecture, testing and debugging specifications, a trace specification, and other related artifacts. These are produced through a collaborative process among thousands of people, with rigorous feedback and oversight. RISC-V International was founded to shepherd this process, curate the specifications using the best practices of both standards organizations and the open source process, and to provide value for both members and the wider community.                                                                                                   

**Evolution of RISC-V International**

The RISC-V Foundation was founded in 2015 to build an open, collaborative community of software and hardware innovators based on the RISC-V ISA. The Foundation, a non-profit corporation controlled by its members, directed the development to drive the initial adoption of the RISC-V ISA.

Across 2018-2019, the RISC-V community reflected on the geo-political landscape and heard concerns from around the world that investment in RISC-V must come with IP access continuity to ensure a long-term strategic investment.

Incorporation in Switzerland has the effect of calming concerns of political disruption to the open collaboration model. As a non-profit, membership-based organization, RISC-V International does not maintain any commercial interest in products or services. There have not been any export restrictions on RISC-V in the US. The move does not circumvent any existing restrictions, but rather alleviates uncertainty going forward.

In March 2020, the RISC-V International Association was incorporated in Switzerland. Along with this, it shifted to a new, more inclusive membership structure. Members of RISC-V International not only have access to the RISC-V ISA specification, extensions, and related hardware and software, but also are eligible to participate in the development of these components.

The IP contributed and produced by RISC-V International is held under industry and global standard licenses that are already open to leverage by any company regardless of jurisdiction. This licensing is a common open source approach to foster collaboration that is not tied to any geographic regulation. Open Source IP has not been subject to export control.

We encourage organizations, individuals, and enthusiasts to join our ecosystem and together enable a new era of processor innovation through open standard and open source collaboration.

****RISC-V International Membership

RISC-V is a non-profit membership-based organization that is driven by its members through representative governance on a board of directors, a technical steering committee, and many other working committees.

Membership is offered at various levels, and members receive a wealth of benefits. Most importantly, the membership process provides intellectual property projection for all members as well as provenance and IP security for the RISC-V ISA itself, which is RISC-V International’s top priority. All members are able to participate fully in the technical development process as well as in project administration through various working groups and committees. Members are also able to participate in a number of annual events and workshops and to stay on the leading edge of RISC-V development. All benefits are outlined on the RISC-V membership page.

So, why does RISC-V insist on membership rather than opening contribution and participation to the general public in the manner of the Linux kernel and many other open source software projects?

The primary reason for this is the IP protection just mentioned. The RISC-V membership agreement and the Articles of Association provide solid protection, but their scope is limited to members who actually sign the agreement.

While active participation is limited to members for this reason, RISC-V does make the entire technical process transparent (in read-only fashion) to non-members, and provides a wealth of learning opportunities as well as a set of public discussion lists where experienced RISC-V developers often contribute.

Membership in RISC-V is free for individual people, academic institutions, and non-profit organizations. For-profit companies have three membership levels available with annual dues, which support the ongoing collective support, facilitation, and advocacy of RISC-V as well as the following programs to foster the technical development, academic inclusion, market adoption, and industry visibility of our RISC-V community and members.

All Organizational members — Premier, Strategic, and Community Organization — have access to the RISC-V Trademark, which includes the RISC-V name and logo.

**RISC-V International Governance**

RISC-V International is governed by its Board of Directors. The Board is composed of Directors elected to represent all classes of membership to ensure the offering of a strategic voice at all levels. In addition, the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) provides leadership to the organization’s technical initiatives in setting long-term strategy, forming tactical committees and work groups, and approving technical deliverables for ratification or release.

RISC-V International also supports and drives ad hoc and standing groups to pursue specific industry, geographic, and strategic interests through a variety of constructs. The aim of RISC-V International is to guide and facilitate the broadest and most effective collaboration for the benefit of their member community.

                                                                                             **The RISC-V Community**


**RISC-V Community Working Model**

Community development is core to RISC-V International – there is no single company behind the scenes, and without the active community of architects and developers, there would be no RISC-V.

Specification development teams – whom we call the “tech” community – are composed of RISC-V International members, including both individuals and organizations. Although each member participates at their own level, we welcome everyone’s voice in the development process. Working groups and committees are chaired by member organizations, but it is possible for sufficiently enthusiastic and skilled individual members to help lead a working group if they earn support from the community and the Technical Steering Committee (TSC).

All members are welcome to participate and contribute in technical groups through mailing lists, meetings and workshops, webinars and conferences, and in many other ways. The technical working groups are publicly visible so that non-members can also follow discussions and progress.

In addition, there are three public forums where anyone may participate:

The RISC-V public mailing lists, particularly ISA-Dev and SW-Dev, which date back to the earliest days of RISC-V
The Exchange forums which provide a focused discussion point for items that appear on the RISC-V Exchange
The RISC-V Slack channel for live chat

**RISC-V’s Relationship with the Linux Foundation**

In November 2018, the RISC-V Foundation announced a joint collaboration with the Linux Foundation. As part of this collaboration, the Linux Foundation provides operational, technical, and strategic support for RISC-V International, including member management, accounting, training programs, infrastructure tools, community outreach, marketing, legal, and other open source services and expertise.

**The RISC-V Ecosystem**

As previously mentioned, RISC-V relies on its members to operate. The body of members across many different technical and application areas is known as the RISC-V Ecosystem. You can look at a comprehensive view by visiting the RISC-V Landscape website. 

There you’ll find an interactive view of key RISC-V contributors with clickable links to learn more about them. These contributors are organized by the type of product or service they provide, both in software and hardware. There are categories like applications, libraries, operating systems, implementations, and so on.

The RISC-V Ecosystem shows some of the numerous areas of application where you may contribute.

The RISC-V ecosystem is constantly growing, as more and more areas of application continue to emerge. The RISC-V ecosystem is also organized separately in certain segments. For example, you can learn about the RISC-V Software Ecosystem by visiting the Rise project website. This is an effort led by industry leaders to promote the development of open software for RISC-V .

Just by looking at the main member logos, you may get an idea of how serious the software industry is about RISC-V, and the type of investment that is being put into the future of computing with this architecture.

**Communication Channels**

Communication is the most critical part of community-based development, whether in open source software, open specifications, open standards or any other type of shared resource development. RISC-V uses best practices drawn from decades of experience in open source and academia.

The technical organization operates on a group of policies which are often updated to include best practices. These policies form the basis for the development processes within RISC-V and enable more than 2,000 developers to work together.

**The RISC-V Exchange**

The RISC-V Exchange is a special resource that provides a window into work that people have accomplished around the world in the RISC-V community, including educational material, physical hardware, IP cores, and a great deal of software. This section of our website is growing as hardware and software continue to be created.

**Contribute to RISC-V**

There are as many ways to contribute to RISC-V as there are components in an instruction set architecture’s ecosystem.

Here are some ways you may contribute to the RISC-V community:

Build RISC-V knowledge through the Learn resources.

Become a RISC-V Ambassador technical expert.

Post RISC-V technical position openings on RISC-V Careers.

Become a mentor and guide a RISC-V Mentorship project.

Help maintain the technical specifications.

Write and share your own RISC-V projects.

For a detailed list of ways you may contribute, be sure to read the RISC-V Member Benefits and Welcome presentation.

**Types of Contributions**

Technical Contributions

To learn about the process of contributing to RISC-V on a technical level, please read the Developer Getting Started Guide in the RISC-V Technical Wiki.

To contribute to a specification or a technical area, you may look for the most relevant group in Groups.IO, join it, follow the discussions on the mailing list, attend the meetings, and volunteer to help.

To propose a new group, specification, or topic, send an email to help@riscv.org for guidance on where to start.

Proposing New Instructions

RISC-V was designed to allow anyone to add new instructions to the base ISA and any of its extensions. You can do this freely on your own implementations, but you may also contribute to the official ISA specifications. For the latter, you must become an active member of the RISC-V community in charge of maintaining the documents you intend to contribute to. These communities are specified in the RISC-V Technical Wiki.

Identifying and Resolving Issues in GitHub

The RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) and related specifications are developed, ratified and maintained by RISC-V International contributing members within the RISC-V International Technical Working Groups. Work on the specification is performed on GitHub, and the GitHub issue mechanism can be used to provide input into the specification.
